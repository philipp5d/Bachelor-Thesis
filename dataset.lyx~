Dataset
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The university hospital Freiburg has a database of approximately 300.000

 physician letters.
 For every patient the database contains several letters, as a new visit
 will often result in a modified letter that will be stored as well.
 These physician letters are free text documents written by the doctors
 to keep record of the patient's visit.
 They usually include information about the patient's age, sex, diagnosed
 diseases, therapy history, current complaints, many more medical details
 like blood counts, but also personal information like names and birthdates.
 The letters usually follow a rough structure, but doctors are in principal
 free to document the information in the way they please.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From this database we acquired a subset of 307 letters with the help of
 former medical director

Professor Dr.
 Drs.
 h.c.
 Roland Mertelsmann and his student Vera Hilmer.
 Professor Mertelsmann selected the letters of cancer patients he had treated
 over a recent period of time and Vera Hilmer made them anonymous, so they
 could be shared with us.
 This procedure consumed considerable time and money and is not scalable
 to the whole database.
 Methods for semi-automatic anonymization and other possible solutions will
 be discussed below.
 Note also that not all of the letters were written by Prof Mertelsmann,

which is an important aspect for the evalutation of our algorithms.
 Unfortunately 18 of the 307 letters are duplicates and thereby not usable
 for our analysis.
 We excluded another 3 letters, that contain almost no information about
 the patient (this kind of letter is produced due to the specific kind of
 documentation process at the clinic).
 Another 17 are

follow-up

 letters i.e.
 letters of the same patient at a later point in time.
 This left us with the letters of 269 individual patients (the follow-up
 letters were only used where stated explicitly).
 Note that it is not a trivial task to ensure that the set of letters contains
 neither duplicates nor follow-ups.
 Automated aids for this problem will be discussed below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For our goals of extracting information from and finding similarities between
 the letters we additionally needed supervised information.
 For a subset of 135 letters we obtained supervised labels of two kinds.
 One, we manually labeled the letters for whether or not the patients suffered
 from specific diseases common among those patiens.
 These labels were checked by Prof.
 Mertelsmann for correctness.
 Two, Prof.
 Mertelsmann provided us with a grouping of these 135 patients into 50 non-overl
apping groups.
 This grouping is meant to reflect his expert intuition about similarities
 between patients, that might not be capturable in simple rule based (disease
 based) grouping approaches.
 These groups are then used as information about how physician letters should
 be rated as similar.
 After using this data to tweak our algorithm to produce good similarity
 ratings, we performed a psychological experiment with [replace] medicine
 students and [replace] doctors.
 We thereby obtained more human expert intuition information about how well
 our algorithms find similarities.
 With these data we tried several approaches for automatic extraction of
 information from the letters and automatic similarity ratings between them.
