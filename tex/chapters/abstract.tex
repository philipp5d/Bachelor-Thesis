When faced with exceptional clinical cases, doctors would often like to review information about similar patients to guide their decision-making for the current one. Retrieving the relevant cases, however, is a hard and time-consuming task. This thesis works on building a recommender system that automatically finds physician letters similar to a specified reference letter with information retrieval methods. We use a small dataset of free text physician letters of oncology patients to do exploratory work on this issue. We provide a prototypical system that gives recommendations on this dataset and verify its performance through a psychological experiment assessing physicians' similarity judgments of those letters. We find that the similarity measure of our recommender system correlates strongly with doctors' similarity judgments. Additionally, we explore other text mining applications like searching for letters more intelligently, based on this dataset.
