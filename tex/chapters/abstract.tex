In unusual clinical situations doctors would often like to review cases of similar patients to guide their decision making for the current one. To retrieve the relevant cases however is a hard and time consuming task. This thesis works on building a recommender system that automatically finds physician letters similar to a reference letter in an information retrieval like manner. We use a small dataset of free text physician letters of oncology patients to do exploratory work on this issue. We provide a prototypical system that gives recommendations on this dataset and verify its performance through a psychological experiment assessing doctor's similarity judgments of those letters. We find that the similarity measure of our recommender system correlates strongly with doctor's similarity judgments. Additionally we explore other text mining applications like automatic diagnosis extraction based on this dataset.
