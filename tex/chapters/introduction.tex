\chapter{Introduction}
\label{ch:introduction}
%There are journals about case reports. -> It seems that information about individual cases is useful for doctors when reasoning about new patients. Indeed in the cognitive science literature it is documented, that humans often reason either case-based or prototype based. There is even a whole branch of AI dealing with learning to reason based on example cases, case-based reasoning.

%It seems like recommending cases similar to a current patient would be helpful for doctors for their clinical decision making. There are databases with a wealth of patient information, namely free text physician letters. However, search is limited to string matching approaches.
%-> A more elaborate automatic analysis of similarity between letters would be useful.

%For this task we obtained a small dataset from the university hospital Freiburg, on which we build a prototype of a recommender system for similar letters and explore other automatic information extraction procedures.

\section{Motivation}

Publishing the case of a patient with a particularly interesting medical phenomenon in the form of a clinical case report has seen a change in popularity in the medical community.
%The clinical case report, a scientific publication dealing with the specifics of one particularly interesting patient, has undergone a renewal of status in the medical community. 
The number of published case reports has been declining in standard journals. This has happened not only because case reports can hardly contribute to a good impact factor, but also because their scientific benefit has been questioned \citep{Mason2001}. However, several new journals dedicated only to case reports have emerged \citep{Kidd2007}(how to cite a journal's existence, which does not have an introductory article?) and many people have argued for the value of case reports for research itself but also beyond \citep{Williams2003,Dib2008,Sandu2016}. Importantly case reports allow practitioners a more in-depth understanding of specific disease courses and provide educational material for students \citep{Nissen2014}. Although case reports lack the scientific validity of large empirical studies, it is apparent that people have strong intuitions for the usefulness of them. During our collaboration with practicing doctors we also found that practitioners use the clinical records of similar patients to guide problem solving for the current patient. Especially when faced with hard or unusual cases doctors seek similar patient information from the hospital database. While this only shows that doctors think that the presentation of similar cases helps them in their work, we will argue that it can indeed improve medical problem solving. 

Cognitive Scientists have discussed the usefulness of examples for reasoning processes for long and found that at least in some experimental settings reasoning processes are based on earlier presented examples \citep{Medin1978}. More recently these reasoning processes have also been studied in more realistic scenarios. \citet{Klein2008} reviews models for decision making under real world circumstances. According to him experts interpret a situation based on its resemblance to remembered situations. Once a sufficiently similar situation has been retrieved from memory, experts apply the solution from the remembered situation to the current one in a thought experiment. They evaluate whether or not this solution strategy will lead to success and adjust it, if necessary. In case no way to adequately adjust the solution can be found, another situation is retrieved from memory. This process is repeated until a sufficiently good solution is found. Presentation of similar cases should therefore aid doctor's decision making in an actual clinical setting. The medical domain has also been directly addressed by research in cognitive science. \citet{Elstein2002} have concluded that for medical problem solving reasoning processes can be divided into two distinct categories. For cases perceived as easy doctors apply a kind of pattern recognition based on the examples they have encountered before and use solutions stored in memory. For harder cases, however, doctors need to rely on a more elaborate reasoning process. They have to consciously generate and eliminate hypotheses to be able to solve the problem. It is plausible that hypothesis generation as well as hypothesis falsification is also guided by the doctor's experience of earlier patients. From a more theoretical perspective \citet{Kolodner1987} have specifically argued that ``[i]ndividual experiences act as exemplars upon which to base later decisions'' in medical problem solving. Their research was partially driven by the desire to understand the way in which clinicians perform problem solving but also by the goal of building artificial systems that can aid in this process. They argue that both learn from specific examples and use them to reason about new problems.

Around the idea that artificial systems might learn from examples has evolved a whole branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI), which is called ``Case-based reasoning''. This domain has been greatly influenced by psychological findings, some of them mentioned above. It has successfully built systems used in real world applications, that reason from the examples provided  \citep{Aamodt1994}. Within this domain of AI one of the greatest application areas is medicine. It seems that this area does not only offer straight forward usage of examples, but also has a need for automatic aids for problem solving \citep{Begum2011}.

%Indeed in cognitive science a branch of research exists that is concerned with "exemplar" or "instance"-based reasoning. In exemplar theories it is assumed that humans categorize objects based on examples stored in memory \citep{Medin1978}. However, according to \citet{Elstein2002} medical decision making can be divided into two subcategories. In cases perceived as easily solvable doctors can use pattern recognition, which can be based on previous examples, to come to a decision. In hard cases though, experts fall back to conscious hypothesis generation and elimination. We want to deal mainly with hard cases, as experts will only then seek the help of a recommender system. In those hard cases experts use hypothesis testing and therefore similar examples can provide new ideas for hypothesis formulation or help remove irrelevant or wrong hypotheses. NDM, especially RPD model asserts that experts interpret a situation based on its resemblance to an old situation, but then think the current situation through with the old strategy and see whether it would work here as well. Similar cases can show a possible, plausible strategy path and then the doctor can think it through and take this strategy or reject it based on similarity between the cases.
%Even better use Kolodner Paper!

Given the practical, psychological and theoretical reflections above we believe that it would be helpful for practitioners to be able to review cases of similar patients. One particularly well suited source for the retrieval of patient cases are databases of physician letters, as they provide concise summaries of the specifics that matter in practice. Search in these databases is, to our knowledge, usually limited to character matching procedures and therefore provides limited practical value for doctors. We therefore set out to build a recommender system on those physician letters to do automatic retrieval of only the relevant documents from a database.
