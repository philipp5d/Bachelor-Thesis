The next section includes more medical parameters not related to one specific diagnosis. Then the therapy history is shown, including medical disease parameters over time and special results obtained e.g. during an MRI.}

Then the current anamnesis is shown, where e.g. the patient's current complaints are listed. The subsequent paragraph discusses the procedure for the next six months. Finally ``goodbye regards'' are given.}

\chapter{Code}
The Python code comprising the recommender system itself and all experiments and evaluations we have done is attached to the printed version of this thesis as a hard copy on DVD. However, the dataset of physician letters is not included. Personal information of the patients might still be present despite our efforts to remove it.  Consequently, we prefer not to make this dataset publicly available.
